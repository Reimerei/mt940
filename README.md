This is a library to parse MT940 and MT942 account statements. It was ported from Ruby and is based on
[Thies C. Arntzen's mt940 library](https://github.com/betterplace/mt940_parser).
The MT94x category of SWIFT messages are meant for customer statements and cash management:
- **MT940** is the standard structured _Customer Statement Message_ format (end-of-day statement file which details all entries booked to a bank account). Usually you receive a customer statement message the next morning of the day of business.
- **MT942** is the standard structured _Interim Transaction Report_ format. MT942 gives a report of the debits/credits any given time of the day.

## Basic usage

Include a dependency in your `mix.exs`:

```elixir
deps: [{:mt940, "~> 1.1.0"}, â€¦]
```

`use MT940` and `parse!` the raw input:

```elixir
defmodule BankAccount do
  use MT940

  def balance(raw) when is_binary(raw) do
    %{amount: amount, currency: currency} = raw
    |> parse!
    |> Enum.at(-1)
    |> MT940.CustomerStatementMessage.closing_balance
    "#{amount} #{currency}"
  end

  def transactions(raw) when is_binary(raw) do
    raw
    |> parse!
    |> Enum.flat_map(&MT940.CustomerStatementMessage.statement_lines/1)
  end
end
```

If you want to have a more detailed, low-level list of MT940 commands, use the
`MT940.Parser.parse!` command.
